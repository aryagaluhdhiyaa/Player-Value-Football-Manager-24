# Player Value Football Manager 24
How do you know if a player is Undervalued or Overvalued? If you know they're Age, Current Ability (CA), and Potential Abliity (PA) if you're experienced in Football Manager 24 you can kinda know it.
So what i did is try to mathematically see it it possible to see it. And from what i have tested you can.
How does it Work?
